paperweight
===========
This took me about 7 hours to complete, but I spent about 2 of those trying to perfect animations..

Tasks completed:
Dragging the headline should reveal the menu
If you're dragging down, releasing the headline should animate the headline to the down position
If you're dragging up, releasing the headline should animate the headline to the up position
If you're dragging the headline up past the top, the friction should increase

Partially completed but didn't have time to perfect:
Optional: Dragging on the scrollable feed of headlines should change the scale of the feed
