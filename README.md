paperweight
===========
This took me about 7 hours to complete, but I spent about 2 of those trying to perfect animations..

Tasks completed:</br>
Dragging the headline should reveal the menu</br>
If you're dragging down, releasing the headline should animate the headline to the down position</br>
If you're dragging up, releasing the headline should animate the headline to the up position</br>
If you're dragging the headline up past the top, the friction should increase</br>
</br>
Partially completed but didn't have time to perfect:</br>
Optional: Dragging on the scrollable feed of headlines should change the scale of the feed</br>
